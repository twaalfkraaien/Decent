# üëç Not Amazing, Not Good. Just Decent!

Decent! is a modpack built just for the sake of being able to toss it on anything or at anyone and just have it _work_. Throw it on your PC, Steam Deck or handheld of choice, the monolith,  Xerxes the Demon who lives under your bed's laptop. It should **just work.**

## ‚ùî Why was this made? Why should I use it?

This was made literally out of frustration of having to constantly sift around for a ton of mods, and additionally with modrinth having a very annoying way of setting up collections and what not. So why not make an easily distributible pack?

Additonally, this pack can just be taken and used to make *almost* any modpack you can think of, as long as you provide the mods, and additional work, everything should be more or less drag and drop! All the way to the server.

## üì¶ Features
- MidnightControls, controller support, for when you just can't M&K.
- Inventory management and sorting
